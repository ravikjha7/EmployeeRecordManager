	Let's Get Started :
		
		1) This is an Program made by Ravi Jha (Vishal Jha) GitHub : ravikjha7 .

		2) The Program is completely written in C Language.

		3) I had made this project for My Semester Assignment , But I decided to Upload it on GitHub So That Everyone Can Get Benefit 			   		   	
		   From It.

		4) This Program Has Been Coded On Visual Studio , You Can Use The Same For Running The Project ( You Can Use Command Prompt as well )
		
		5) The Program is an Open Source Project , and No Copyright Strike Will be Charged For Using The Project.

		6) The Program Stores The Data Of The Employees Of The Company and Also Has The Option to Update Details Whenever Required.

		   (Also Stores The Last Updated Time so that if Someone Changes the Details , You will get aware about it)

		7) I Have Not Tested The Program on an Online Compiler , But I don't Think it will work on The Online Compiler as The Program needs access 		   	   
		   to the File Storage.

		8) No Program in the World is Bug-Free , If You find any Bug in the Program or You Have any Idea on Improving The Program You are Free To 		   	   
		   Contribute it on GitHub or Comment About It.

		9) The Program Requires a Password To Login. 
		
		   Current Password : ravi

	       10) You Can Update The Password , There is an Option In The Menu of The Program To Change The Password.
